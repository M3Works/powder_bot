## Installation

### Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
You can create a virtual environment using `venv` or `conda`. Here is how to do it with `venv`:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Installing dependencies

To run the notebooks, you will need to install the required Python packages.
You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Jupyter Notebook
To run the Jupyter notebooks, you need to have Jupyter installed.
If you have installed the dependencies using the `requirements.txt`,
Jupyter should already be installed. You can start Jupyter Notebook with the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
